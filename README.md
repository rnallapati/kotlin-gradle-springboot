This docker-compose.yml file and Dockerfile will create a container for kotlin/gradle/springboot web server.  
  
Please go to https://start.spring.io/ and generate an initial project with gradle/kotlin option and download the generated zip file.  
  
Extract the contents of the zip file to app/ folder. Then go to where docker-compose.yml file is via terminal, type docker compose up --build  
  
You should be able to see Hello World! in http://localhost:8080/
  
There's already a sample application in /app/ folder.  The sample application was generated using the follwing options:  
  
Project: Gradle - Kotlin  
Language: Kotlin  
Spring Boot: 3.0.2  
Java: 17
Dependencies: Spring Web (click on ADD DEPENDENCIES and select Spring Web)  
  
It is probably a good idea get the latest/preferred version from the start.spring.io.
